# Artemis - AI Sales Intelligence Platform

## Inspiration

The B2B sales landscape is evolving rapidly, yet sales teams still spend 70% of their time on non-selling activities - researching prospects, qualifying leads, and managing data across disparate systems. We were inspired to build Artemis after witnessing firsthand how AI could transform this process.

Our vision was to create an intelligent sales assistant that doesn't just store data, but actively discovers, enriches, and qualifies prospects using AI agents. We imagined a world where sales teams could focus on what they do best - building relationships and closing deals - while AI handles the heavy lifting of prospect research and qualification.

## How we built it

### **Architecture Overview**
```
Frontend (React + Vite) ‚Üí Backend (Node.js + Express) ‚Üí Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
                                    ‚Üì
                            AI Services (Arcade, LlamaIndex)
                                    ‚Üì
                            External APIs (BrightData, Enrichment)
```

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts for visualizations
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, ES Modules, Socket.io for real-time updates
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **AI Integration**: 
  - **Mastra Framework**: AI workflow orchestration and agent management
  - Arcade AI for agent orchestration
  - LlamaIndex for LLM operations
- **Data Collection**: 
  - **BrightData**: Web scraping infrastructure and proxy networks for prospect discovery
  - Custom scrapers for LinkedIn and company websites
- **Data Pipeline**: Custom ETL system with staging tables and automated processing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, ready for Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) deployment

### **Key Implementation Details**
1. Built a robust data pipeline with staging and quarantine tables
2. Implemented service-oriented architecture for modular functionality
3. Created real-time WebSocket connections for live updates
4. Developed comprehensive validation and normalization services
5. Integrated multiple AI services for intelligent prospect analysis

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. **Database Schema Evolution**
The most significant challenge was discovering that critical pipeline tables (`prospects_staging` and `prospects_quarantine`) were missing from the production database. We had to carefully create migration scripts that wouldn't affect existing data while adding the necessary infrastructure.

### 2. **AI Agent Coordination with Mastra**
Orchestrating multiple AI agents to work together seamlessly required careful state management and error handling. Using Mastra's workflow framework, we implemented a system to ensure agents could pass context and results between each other efficiently.

### 3. **Data Quality at Scale**
Processing thousands of prospects from various sources meant dealing with inconsistent data formats, duplicates, and invalid entries. We built a comprehensive validation system with over 15 validation rules and a quarantine mechanism for edge cases.

### 4. **Real-time Performance**
Maintaining sub-second response times while processing AI operations required implementing caching strategies, database indexing, and efficient query patterns.

### 5. **Authentication & Multi-tenancy**
Building a secure multi-workspace system with proper data isolation required implementing Row Level Security policies and careful permission management.

### 6. **Frontend Development & Real-time Updates**
Creating a responsive, modern frontend that could handle real-time data updates was challenging. We had to implement WebSocket connections properly, managing connection states, reconnection logic, and ensuring the UI stayed synchronized with backend changes without overwhelming the browser.

### 7. **WebSocket Integration Complexity**
Getting WebSockets to work seamlessly with the React frontend required careful handling of:
- Connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- Authentication tokens in WebSocket handshakes
- Graceful fallbacks when WebSocket connections failed
- Synchronizing WebSocket events with React state management
- Handling race conditions between REST API calls and WebSocket updates

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

### ‚ú® **Fully Automated Data Pipeline**
We built a production-ready ETL pipeline that processes prospects every minute, automatically validating, normalizing, and enriching data without human intervention.

### üéØ **Intelligent Deduplication**
Our fuzzy matching algorithm can identify duplicate prospects even with variations in names, emails, and company information, maintaining data integrity at scale.

### üöÄ **Zero to Production Ready**
Created a complete full-stack application with authentication, real-time updates, and AI integration that's ready for production deployment.

### üìä **Comprehensive Testing Suite**
Developed extensive testing utilities that validate every component of the data pipeline, ensuring reliability and data quality.

### üîê **Enterprise-Grade Security**
Implemented Row Level Security, API rate limiting, and proper authentication flows to ensure data security and system stability.

### üé® **Seamless Real-time Frontend**
Successfully built a modern React frontend with full WebSocket integration, providing users with instant updates as prospects are discovered, scored, and enriched - creating a truly real-time experience without page refreshes.

## What we learned

### 1. **AI Orchestration Complexity**
Coordinating multiple AI agents requires careful consideration of context passing, error handling, and fallback strategies. We learned to design systems that gracefully degrade when AI services are unavailable.

### 2. **Data Pipeline Design**
Building a robust data pipeline taught us the importance of staging areas, validation layers, and quarantine systems. The ETL pattern proved invaluable for maintaining data quality.

### 3. **Real-time Architecture**
Implementing WebSocket connections alongside REST APIs showed us how to balance real-time requirements with system resources and scaling considerations.

### 4. **Database Design for AI Applications**
We learned that AI applications require flexible schema designs to accommodate varying data structures while maintaining query performance.

### 5. **User Experience in B2B Tools**
B2B users expect consumer-grade experiences. We focused on making complex features feel simple through thoughtful UI/UX design.
