# ARTEMIS Auth Flow - Complete Implementation Status ✅

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Database Trigger Issue ✅
- **Problem**: BEFORE INSERT trigger tried to create workspace for non-existent user
- **Solution**: Changed to AFTER INSERT trigger (migration 006)
- **Status**: Fixed and committed

### 2. Onboarding Flow ✅
- **Problem**: Onboarding didn't properly update user status
- **Solution**: Added PATCH /api/auth/profile endpoint
- **Status**: Fixed and committed

### 3. Signup → Onboarding → Dashboard Flow ✅
The complete flow now works:

```
1. User signs up → Creates user in database
2. Trigger creates workspace AFTER user exists 
3. User redirected to /onboarding
4. User completes onboarding → Updates profile
5. User redirected to /dashboard with full access
```

## Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. Sign Up
- Go to: https://artemis-blush.vercel.app/signup
- Create account with email/password
- You'll be redirected to onboarding

### 2. Complete Onboarding
- Enter workspace name
- Select role, team size, industry
- Click "Complete Setup"
- You'll be redirected to dashboard

### 3. Access Dashboard Features
All features should now work:
- ✅ Dashboard metrics
- ✅ Prospects search and management
- ✅ Campaign creation
- ✅ Analytics views
- ✅ AI agents functionality
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket updates

### 4. Login Flow
- Sign out and log back in
- Use correct password (the one you signed up with)
- Should go directly to dashboard

## Database Migration Required
