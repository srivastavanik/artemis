# ARTEMIS Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UI Design Consistency
- **Problem**: The deployed site had inconsistent styling with heavy fonts and cluttered design
- **Solution**: Updated all pages to use a clean, minimal dark theme with:
  - Light and extra-light font weights throughout
  - Consistent spacing and borders using gray-800
  - Gradient text effects for key headings
  - Subtle hover states and transitions
  - Removed all glass morphism effects for cleaner appearance

### 2. Files Updated
- **Home.jsx**: Clean landing page with minimal design
- **Layout.jsx**: Simplified navigation with consistent styling
- **Dashboard.jsx**: Streamlined metrics display with clear hierarchy
- **Prospects.jsx**: Clean table design with subtle hover states
- **Campaigns.jsx**: Simplified campaign builder interface
- **Analytics.jsx**: Clear data visualization with minimal borders
- **Login.jsx**: Clean authentication form
- **Signup.jsx**: Simplified registration with benefit highlights

### 3. Design Principles Applied
- **Typography**: font-light and font-extralight used consistently
- **Colors**: Black background (#000) with gray-800 borders
- **Accents**: Indigo, purple, blue gradients for highlights
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Interactions**: Subtle hover states with smooth transitions

### 4. Next Steps
The Vercel deployment should automatically update with these changes. The site will now have:
- Consistent minimal design across all pages
- Better readability with light fonts
- Professional appearance matching modern SaaS standards
