# Auth Fix Status

## What's Fixed ‚úÖ
1. **Backend CORS** - Added PATCH method
2. **Backend Routes** - Auth routes are properly registered at `/api/auth/*`
3. **Database Relationships** - Fixed ambiguous workspace relationships
4. **Frontend API Service** - Updated to add `/api` prefix to all endpoints
5. **Backend Frontend Serving** - Won't try to serve frontend files when deployed separately

## Current Issue üîÑ
The frontend changes haven't deployed to Vercel yet. The latest commit with API fixes needs to deploy.

## What's Happening:
```
Frontend (OLD): POST https://artemis-e8tw.onrender.com/auth/signup ‚ùå
Frontend (NEW): POST https://artemis-e8tw.onrender.com/api/auth/signup ‚úÖ
```

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for Vercel to deploy the latest changes (usually 1-2 minutes)
2. Or trigger a manual redeploy in Vercel dashboard
3. Clear browser cache and try again

## Testing the Fix:
Once deployed, the auth flow should work:
1. Signup at https://artemis-murex.vercel.app/signup
2. Complete onboarding
3. Access full dashboard

## Backend is Ready ‚úÖ
The backend logs show all auth routes are available:
- POST /api/auth/signup
- POST /api/auth/signin
- GET /api/auth/me
- PATCH /api/auth/profile
- etc.

The frontend just needs to deploy with the updated API paths!
